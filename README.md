## üìù Project Brief

The `sum-of-sales` project is a lightweight, single-page web application designed to efficiently process and display sales data. It fetches a `data.csv` file, calculates the sum of its 'sales' column, dynamically updates the page title, and presents the total in a clear, user-friendly interface styled with Bootstrap 5.

## ‚ú® Features

This application provides the following core functionalities:

*   **Asynchronous Data Fetching:** Securely fetches `data.csv` from a relative path using the modern Fetch API.
*   **Sales Aggregation:** Automatically parses the CSV data and calculates the sum of the 'sales' column.
*   **Dynamic Title Generation:** Sets the browser tab title to "Sales Summary 12345" upon successful data processing.
*   **Clear Sales Display:** Presents the calculated total sales amount within a designated HTML element (`#total-sales`).
*   **Responsive Design:** Utilizes Bootstrap 5 for a clean, modern, and responsive user interface, ensuring a consistent experience across various devices.
